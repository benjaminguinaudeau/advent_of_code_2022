# Advent of code 2022

This repo gathers my solutions to the [Advent of code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/)

  + [Day 1](https://github.com/benjaminguinaudeau/advent_of_code_2022/blob/main/day_1.md)
  + [Day 2](https://github.com/benjaminguinaudeau/advent_of_code_2022/blob/main/day_2.md)
  + [Day 3](https://github.com/benjaminguinaudeau/advent_of_code_2022/blob/main/day_3.md)
  
If you tired of exporting the problem data as .csv, {[adventr](https://github.com/benjaminguinaudeau/adventr)} is small package that you might enjoy. 

It does one thing, but it does it good: loading problem data from the [Advent of code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/) in your session.
