# Advent of code 2022

This repo gathers my solutions to the [Advent of code
2022](https://adventofcode.com/)

If you tired of exporting the problem data as .csv,
{[adventr](https://github.com/benjaminguinaudeau/adventr)} is small
package that you might enjoy.

It does one thing, but it does it good: loading problem data from the
[Advent of code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/) in your session.
